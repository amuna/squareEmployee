## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I focused on architecture the most. The app follows clean architecture and incorporates MVVM design with dependency injection.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
Architecture design is what I enjoy most about mobile development. I would also say that this is an area of strength of mine and want to highlight it.

## How long did you spend on this project?
About 5-6 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
I would have spent more time on UI. It is very simple and plain. Here is a project that I spent more time designing the UI and consider a good design.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
UI Design

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
I did read a lot of articles and examples of how to use coroutine and how to test with them.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
I focused on simplicity for this app. I used kodein instead of dagger for dependency injection as it was simpler to use.
I was not very familiar with coroutine before this project but I figured out parts of it to make everything work.
I'd say I did a good job and look forward to your insight!
